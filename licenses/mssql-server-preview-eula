MICROSOFT PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT SQL SERVER (PREVIEW)

===============================================================================

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on
where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to
the pre-release software named above, which includes the media on which you
received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft
	-	updates,
	-	supplements,
	-	Internet-based services, and
	-	support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms
apply.

By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not
use the software.

As described below, using some features also operates as your consent to the
transmission of certain standard computer information for Internet-based
services.

===============================================================================

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.

1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

	a.	Installation and Use.
		-	You may install and use up to ten copies of the software on your
premises to design, develop and test your programs for use with the software.
		-	You may not test the software in a live operating environment unless
Microsoft permits you to do so under another agreement.
	b.	Included Microsoft Programs. The software contains other Microsoft
programs. The license terms with those programs apply to your use of them.

2.	INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the
software. It may change or cancel them at any time.
	a.	Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described
below and in the Microsoft Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service
provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive
a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these
features or not use them. For more information about these features, see the
software documentation. By using these features, you consent to the transmission
of this information. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or
contact you.
		i.	Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols,
which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your
Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and
version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where
you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the
Internet-based services available to you.
			-	Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP). This software
uses CEIP. CEIP automatically sends Microsoft information about your hardware
and how you use this software. We do not use this information to identify or
contact you. To learn more about CEIP, see
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=733654&clcid=0x409.
			-	Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates.
These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509
standard encrypted information. They also can be used to digitally sign files
and macros to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents. The software
retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists using the
Internet, when available.
			-	Error Reports. This software automatically sends error reports
to Microsoft. These reports include information about problems that occur in the
software. Sometimes reports contain information about other programs that
interact with the software. Reports might unintentionally contain personal
information. For example, a report that contains a snapshot of computer memory
might include your name. Part of a document you were working on could be
included as well. Microsoft does not use this information to identify or contact
you. To learn more about error reports, see
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=733654&clcid=0x409.
			-	Microsoft Error Reporting Service. This feature helps Microsoft
and Windows partners diagnose problems in the software and provide solutions.
Not all problems will have a solution but when a solution is available, it will
be offered as a step to solve a problem you have reported or as an update to
install. As part of setup and installation, the Microsoft Error Reporting
Service sends to Microsoft information about setup and installation failures in
order to attempt to diagnose the problem. To help prevent problems and make the
software more reliable, some solutions are also included in service packs and
future versions of the software.
		ii.	Use of Information. We may use the computer information, error
reports, and CEIP information, to improve our software and services. We may also
share it with others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may use the
information to improve how their products run with Microsoft software.

3.	TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE. The software will stop running 120 days after you
install it. You will receive notice on the total number of days remaining, until
the time bomb expires, every time you restart the software. You may not be able
to access data used with the software when it stops running.

4.	PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. This software is a pre-release version. It may not
work the way a final version of the software will. We may change it for the
final, commercial version. We also may not release a commercial version.

5.	FEEDBACK. Because this is pre-release software, you agree to give feedback
about the software to Microsoft. You give to Microsoft, without charge, the
right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any
purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights
needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with
any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the
feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires
Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we
include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

6.	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The software, including its user interface,
features and documentation, is confidential and proprietary to Microsoft and its
suppliers.
	a.	Use. For five years after installation of the software or its commercial
release, whichever is first, you may not disclose confidential information to
third parties. You may disclose confidential information only to your employees
and consultants who need to know the information. You must have written
agreements with them that protect the confidential information at least as much
as this agreement.
	b.	Survival. Your duty to protect confidential information survives this
agreement.
	c.	Exclusions. You may disclose confidential information in response to a
judicial or governmental order. You must first give written notice to Microsoft
to allow it to seek a protective order or otherwise protect the information.
Confidential information does not include information that
		-	becomes publicly known through no wrongful act;
		-	you received from a third party who did not breach confidentiality
obligations to Microsoft or its suppliers; or
		-	you developed independently.

7.	.NET FRAMEWORK SOFTWARE. The software contains Microsoft .NET Framework
software. This software is part of Windows. The license terms for Windows apply
to your use of the .NET Framework software.

8.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights.
Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use
the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you
must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you
to use it in certain ways. You may not
	-	disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the software, other than
the Microsoft .NET Framework (see separate term above), to any third party
without Microsoft's prior written approval;
	-	work around any technical limitations in the software;
	-	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only
to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
	-	make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or
allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
	-	publish the software for others to copy;
	-	rent, lease or lend the software;
	-	transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
	-	use the software for commercial software hosting services.

9.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws
and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws
and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on
destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see
www.microsoft.com/exporting.

10.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is "AS IS" may not provide support
services for it.

11.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
agreement for the software and support services.

12.	APPLICABLE LAW.
	a.	United States. If you acquired the software in the United States,
Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to
claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of
the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state
consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
	b.	Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other
country, the laws of that country apply.

13.	LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have
other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with
respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does
not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your
country do not permit it to do so.

14.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed "as-is." You bear
the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or
conditions. You may have additional consumer rights or statutory guarantees
under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent
permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

FOR AUSTRALIA -- You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
Law and nothing in these terms is intended to affect those rights.

15.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from
Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot
recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special,
indirect or incidental damages.

This limitation applies to
	-	anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on
third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
	-	claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted
by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental, consequential or other damages.
